##Dependencies
Normally this package would be assembled with some form of one line install to manage the depencencies, however for the sake of clarity we require some basics to get things up and running:

- Bundler

##Setting up the Application
Install the dependencies with `bundle install`

##Testing
Run spec tests with `rake`

##Start the App Locally For Development
Run `rake start_development`

(Defaults to port 4567 for this Demo)

##Start the App For Testing
Run `rake start`
